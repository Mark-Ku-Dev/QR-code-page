# QR Code Component

A simple, responsive QR code card built with HTML and CSS. This was my solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) QR code component challenge.

## What it does

The page shows a centered card with:

- A QR code image that links to Frontend Mentor
- A short heading about improving front-end skills
- A line of text inviting you to scan the QR code

The card is centered on the page and works on different screen sizes.

## Built with

- **HTML5** – structure and content
- **CSS3** – layout and styling
- **Flexbox** – centering the card and arranging content inside it
- **Google Fonts** – [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) for the text

## How to run it

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qr-code-component-main.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or use “Open with” and choose your browser).

No build step or server needed — it’s plain HTML and CSS.

## What I learned

- Using Flexbox to center content vertically and horizontally
- Styling a card (background, padding, border-radius, box-shadow)
- Linking and using a Google Font
- Keeping the layout readable on different screen sizes with `max-width` and `min-height`
